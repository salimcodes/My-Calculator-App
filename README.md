# Python scripts to provide solutions to complex Mathematical, Electrical and Regular Problems
 
The repository contains interactive python scripts that solves a couple of problem, as created by Salim Oyinlola

# Days Alive Calculator.py
>This is a program that takes input from users - Date of Birth, and using the data and using the datetime function is able to return the number of days the users has spent on the planet. 
>The inputs for the date of birth given in yyyy-mm-dd format.


# Delta-Wye Transforms.py
>This is a program capable of making Delta-Wye/Delta-Star/Node-Mesh transformations.
>The purpose of the program is to provide a platform for simplifying cicuit analysis by successfully replacing delta meshes by equivalent star system and vice versa.
>The program has a try-except statement that helps reduce the occur of error. The numerous if, elif and else statements make the program very intelligent
>The program takes the look of a chatbot due to its intelligence

# Determinant of a Three by Three Matrix.py
>This program takes input for the elements of a three by three matrix and returns the determinant of the matrix

# Four Variable Simultaneous Equation Calculator.py
>This program is used to provide solutions to four variable simultaneous equations. 
>The program uses the determinants methods to calculate all four variables
 
# Inverse of a 3 by 3 Matrix.py
>If a given 3 by 3 matrix is given as Matrix A, this program calculates and returns the Inverse of the matrix given as Matrix A ^(-1) 


# Quadraric Equation.py
>The program being run on this script takes input from the user and returns the roots of a quadratic equation given that b^2 > 4ac.
